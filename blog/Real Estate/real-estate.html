             <p>Many people like my cousin Sam and I long for the freedom of escaping the 9-5 grind and working for themselves. This will be a five or six-part blog. One for each of the streams of income I will be talking about. Most of these income streams are passive or semi-passive. What is the point of living on a sailboat and traveling the world if you're so caught up in trying to pay for that lifestyle that you can't even enjoy it? Ok, enough Introduction. Let's get into things.</p>
             <p>Income Stream No. 1: Real Estate Investing... This is quite possibly the most lucrative Income Stream in this series. This is a business that I know inside and out. My father has been a real estate investor for 20+ years now. There are so many investing techniques you can use. The two main techniques I'll be covering today are wholesaling and rentals.</p>
             <p>Wholesaling: In Wholesaling's simplest form it can be boiled down to finding off-market properties (usually run-down old homes), putting that property under contract, then selling that contract to a buyer for a wholesale fee (usually 5k-10k, sometimes more). I'll dive deeper into the process to help you guys understand. There are many, many ways to find off-market deals. One of the best ones to do remotely is cold calling. Cold calling is pretty much pulling a list of addresses and phone numbers in a certain county (anywhere in the country), and calling those people to see if they want to sell you their house. This can be done completely remotely and can even be outsourced to people in the Philippines for $6/hour. Overall a fantastic way to generate leads. Once you have found the home you put it under contract then sell the contract to a buyer. you will want as big of a buyers list as you can get to send the property to.</p>
             <p>Rentals: There are many ways to acquire rental properties. I will talk about 2 right now. the first is just being on people's buyers lists and buying a good deal that they send out. The next is a good way to get a rental property with exactly zero dollars. I know hard to believe. So the method previously mentioned is called buying subject-to. this means you are buying subject-to the existing mortgage. For example if someone has a $1,000/month payment that they can't keep paying and you can rent that property for $1,300/month... Well there you go. there's $300/month in passive cash flow. This is 3,600/year on just one rental. start racking up 5-6-7 of these and the money starts adding up very quickly.</p>
